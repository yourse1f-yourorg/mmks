          Your package is published on the Habitat depot. You can see it at:

            https://app.habitat.sh/#/pkgs/yourse1f-yourorg/mmks

        * Next Step * : Prepare your target host for deploying the package by
             placing a Secure SHell Remote Procedure Call (SSH RPC) to it :

        cd /home/yourself/projects/mmks;
        ./.habitat/scripts/PushInstallerScriptsToTarget.sh \
              ${TARGET_SRVR} \
              ${SETUP_USER} \
              ${METEOR_SETTINGS_FILE} \
              ${SOURCE_SECRETS_FILE};

      Where :
        TARGET_SRVR is the host where the project will be installed.
        SETUP_USER is a previously prepared 'sudoer' account on '${TARGET_SRVR}'.
        METEOR_SETTINGS_FILE typically called 'settings.json', contains your app's internal settings,
        SOURCE_SECRETS_FILE is the path to a file of required passwords and keys for '${TARGET_SRVR}'.
