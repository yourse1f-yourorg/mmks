# mmks_book

from [GitHub :: Warehouseman  --> Meteor Mantra Kickstarter / Packages / MMKS Book](https://github.com/warehouseman/meteor-mantra-kickstarter/tree/trunk/.pkgs/mmks_book)

A kickstarter CRUD example module extracted to an NPM package.

It is a full-stack module: client, shared and server side code all in a single unit.

This package will NOT work if used without the kickstarter.

(With a few changes), the kickstarter WILL work without this package
